"Using the Arduino core and libraries for the firmware of a commercial product
does not require you to release the source code for the firmware. The LGPL does,
however, require you to make available object files that allow for the relinking
of the firmware against updated versions of the Arduino core and libraries. Any
modifications to the core and libraries must be released under the LGPL."
